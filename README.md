# Data Mining Course Repository

Welcome to the **Data Mining Course Repository** for BS 7. This repository contains all resources, code, and assignments related to the Data Mining course, aimed at building a strong foundation in data analysis and knowledge discovery.

## Course Overview
Data mining involves extracting valuable insights from large datasets, uncovering patterns, and supporting decision-making processes. This course covers fundamental techniques, algorithms, and tools used in data mining, including preprocessing, classification, clustering, association analysis, and more.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Lecture Notes**: Contains lecture slides, notes, and references.
- **Assignments**: Includes all assignments given during the course, along with solutions.
- **Projects**: Holds project files and code relevant to various data mining tasks.
- **Datasets**: Provides datasets used for exercises, assignments, and projects.

## Course Topics
The following topics are covered in this course:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Classification**: Algorithms for categorizing data, including decision trees, Naive Bayes, and k-NN.
3. **Clustering**: Techniques for grouping data, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering.
4. **Association Rule Mining**: Discovering relationships between variables in large datasets.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing data complexity for visualization and processing.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Techniques to assess model performance.
